1. What do we know about the topic of adolescent alcohol consumption
2. What do we know about the parental engagement and behavioural influences
3. What do we know about their relationships in the context of the world and in the context of Asia/South Asia
4. What do we NOT know
5. What this dissertation will add
6. Provide a Sri Lankan context
Write about the Objectives and hypotheses of this dissertation

This chapter can wait until then end, but you will need to think about the OUTLINE

Chapter 3: Methodological approach to the research
This chapter provides and overview of your approach to the research.

This chapter sets out the rationale for your methodology (mixed-methods approach) and the relationship between your qualitative and quantitative studies.

You need to provide an overview and justification of the specific methods you have chosen (eg focus groups and a cross sectional survey) but do not go into detail about the mechanics of these.

You have good material from your proposal and the background papers that you did to start this chapter. What you need first is an OUTLINE.
